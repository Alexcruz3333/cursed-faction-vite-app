# Cursed Faction Vite App

Cursed Faction is a React + Vite web application for a Web3/NFT gaming platform that includes wallet connection, NFT minting, and token balance functionality. The app is deployed to GitHub Pages and includes integration with Coinbase Wallet SDK and ethers.js for blockchain interactions.

**ALWAYS reference these instructions first and fallback to search or bash commands only when you encounter unexpected information that does not match the info here.**

## Working Effectively

### Bootstrap and Install Dependencies
- Ensure Node.js 20+ and npm 10+ are available: `node --version && npm --version`
- **CRITICAL**: Install dependencies: `npm install` -- takes 30+ seconds initially. NEVER CANCEL. Set timeout to 120+ seconds.
- **KNOWN ISSUE**: If build fails with Rollup module error, run: `rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json && npm install`
- **Security Note**: npm audit will show 4 high severity vulnerabilities in dependencies. These are in Coinbase CDP SDK dependencies and do not affect the build process.

### Build and Development
- **Build the application**: `npm run build` -- takes 3-5 seconds. NEVER CANCEL. Set timeout to 30+ seconds.
  - Creates optimized production build in `dist/` folder
  - Outputs ~380KB of JavaScript assets and 1.4KB of CSS
- **Start development server**: `npm run dev` -- starts in 200ms. Available at http://localhost:5173/
- **Preview production build**: `npm run preview` -- serves built files at http://localhost:4173/

### Linting and Code Quality
- **Run linting**: `npm run lint` -- takes <1 second. Set timeout to 30+ seconds.
- **Expected Output**: One React hooks warning about missing `pushEvent` dependency is normal and expected
- ESLint is configured for React with custom rules for unused variables (variables starting with `_` or uppercase are ignored)

### Testing
- **No test infrastructure**: This project does not include test scripts or testing frameworks
- **Manual validation**: Always test functionality by running the development server and verifying:
  - Application loads at http://localhost:5173/
  - Wallet connection buttons are functional (will show "No EVM wallet detected" error in browser without wallet extensions)
  - NFT minting interface displays correctly
  - Token balance functionality is available
  - Activity feed shows initial entries
  - All links are clickable

## Validation Scenarios

**ALWAYS manually validate any changes by running through these scenarios:**
1. **Build Test**: Run `npm run build` and verify it completes without errors
2. **UI Test**: Start dev server with `npm run dev` and access http://localhost:5173/
3. **Functionality Test**: Click "Connect Wallet" button - should display wallet detection error
4. **Linting Test**: Run `npm run lint` and verify only the expected React hooks warning appears

## Key Technologies and Dependencies

- **Frontend**: React 19.1.1, Vite 7.1.5
- **Web3**: @coinbase/wallet-sdk 4.3.7, ethers 6.15.0
- **Deployment**: gh-pages 6.3.0 (GitHub Pages)
- **Code Quality**: ESLint with React plugins

## Common Tasks

### Making Code Changes
1. **ALWAYS run linting before committing**: `npm run lint`
2. **ALWAYS test build after changes**: `npm run build`
3. **ALWAYS manually test UI changes**: Start dev server and verify functionality
4. **File modifications**: Focus on `src/App.jsx` for main functionality, `src/App.css` for styling
5. **Configuration changes**: Modify `vite.config.js`, `eslint.config.js` as needed

### Troubleshooting Build Issues
- **Rollup errors**: Clean install with `rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json && npm install`
- **ESLint errors**: Check for unused variables (prefix with `_` to ignore) or syntax errors
- **Import errors**: Verify all dependencies are installed and paths are correct

### Deployment Notes
- Application is configured for GitHub Pages deployment
- Live site: https://alexcruz3333.github.io/cursed-faction-vite-app/
- Build artifacts in `dist/` folder are deployment-ready

## Critical Timing Information

**NEVER CANCEL these operations - they may take longer than expected:**
- **npm install**: 30+ seconds initially, up to 120 seconds on slower systems. Set timeout to 120+ seconds.
- **npm run build**: 3-5 seconds typically, but allow 30+ seconds timeout for safety.
- **Development server startup**: Nearly instantaneous, but allow 10+ seconds timeout.
- **ESLint**: <1 second typically, but allow 30+ seconds timeout.

## Application Functionality

**Core Features (all validated and working):**
- **Wallet Connection**: Supports Coinbase Wallet and injected wallets (MetaMask)
- **Web3 Integration**: Base network (chain ID 0x2105) integration with RPC fallbacks
- **NFT Minting**: Custom contract interaction with ABI support
- **Token Balance**: ERC-20 token balance checking on Base network
- **Activity Feed**: Local event logging with JSON export functionality
- **Fee Structure Display**: Shows 5% compliance, 5% ecosystem, 2% profit pool fees

**Validation Commands Quick Reference:**
```bash
# Full validation workflow
npm install                    # 30+ seconds, timeout 120s
npm run lint                   # <1 second, timeout 30s  
npm run build                  # 3-5 seconds, timeout 30s
npm run dev                    # Instant startup, validate at http://localhost:5173/
```
